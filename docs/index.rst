====================================

**pypeline version:** |version|

``pypeline`` is a python package that simplifies management of components that may be used in
a python package CI/CD pipeline.  Examples include setup of jenkins build projects and creation
of git lab projects/repositories.

It currently only supports Jenkins and GitLab for the CI and SCM frameworks respectively, but
it is designed to be easily pluggable.
