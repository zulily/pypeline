# Backup script not included, for an example, here is one suggestion:
# https://github.com/sue445/jenkins-backup-script/blob/master/jenkins-backup.sh
#
# Backup jenkins
#30 1 * * *  root service jenkins stop && /usr/local/bin/jenkins_backup /var/lib/jenkins /backups/jenkins ; service jenkins start

# Remove jenkins backups older than 5 days
#30 0 * * * root find /backups/jenkins/ -mtime +5 -exec rm -rf {} \;
